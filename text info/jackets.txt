Endura Convert Softshell Jacket
With its zip-off detachable sleeves, the Convert Softshell quickly turns into a gilet – and back into a jacket, just like the tried and tested Convert Jacket.

This high performance three layer jacket brings together a fast wicking textured polyester inner, a waterproof and highly breathable middle membrane and a beautifully supple polyamide microfiber outer to provide a combination of protection against the elements and a regulated body climate which is further enhanced by the ventilation available through the arm zips when part opened.
